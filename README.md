=======


FROM
Sets the base image for subsequent instructions. 
A valid Dockerfile must start with a `FROM` instruction.
Example: `FROM ubuntu:18.04`

COPY
Copies files or directories from `<src>` 
and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path `<dest>`
Example: `COPY . /app/`
the trailing slask `/` means create this folder if it doesn't exist
Example: `COPY package.json /app/`
Example: `COPY src /app/`

WORKDIR
Sets the working directory 
for any `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY` and `ADD` instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.
Example: `WORKDIR /app`

RUN
Executes any commands in a shell/terminal inside the container environment
The commands add a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. 
The resulting committed image will be used for the next step in the Dockerfile.
Example: `RUN npm install`
Example: `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3`

CMD
Provides defaults for an executing container. 
These can include an executable, or they can omit the executable, in which case you must specify an `ENTRYPOINT` command.
Example: `CMD ["executable","param1","param2"]`
Example: `CMD ["node","server.js"]`

--- other commands ---

ENTRYPOINT
This command allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable.
Example: `ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]`

ADD
This command copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from `<src>` and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path `<dest>`. `ADD` has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support) not present in `COPY`.
Example: `ADD . /app`

EXPOSE
This command informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. 
Example: `EXPOSE 8080`

ENV
This command sets the environment variable `<key>` to the value `<value>`. This value will be in the environment for all subsequent instructions in the build stage and can be replaced inline in many as well.
Example: `ENV MY_NAME="John Doe"`

VOLUME
This command creates a mount point with the specified name and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers.
Example: `VOLUME /myvol`

ARG
This command defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the `docker build` command.
Example: `ARG VERSION=latest`

USER
This command sets the user name (or UID) and optionally the user group (or GID) to use when running the image and for any `RUN`, `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile.
Example: `USER myuser`

Remember, the order of commands in a Dockerfile matters because each command in a Dockerfile results in a new image layer. Later commands can use the results of previous commands. Also, Docker uses a build cache â€“ if a particular command has been executed before and nothing has changed, Docker uses the cached result, which can make building images faster.
